## Whether or not you ran a manual installation process, you must have at least installed the following packages: 

1. Git (to check, on your terminal/PowerShell, run "git")
2. Microsoft Visual Studio Code (to check, look for "Visual Studio Code" in your laptop)
3. Python 3.12 (to check, type "python" or "python3" on your terminal/PowerShell)
4. vscode: jupyter (to check if these packages are there, go to VSCode, and on the left panel, look for and click on a square with four grids ("Extensions"); you must see the packages there)
5. vscode: python
6. vscode: serial-monitor
7. vscode: pylance
8. pip ipykernel
9. pip ipython

10. Make sure the github repository is cloned in the Documents folder of your home directory.

If you are running any other OS, other than Windows or Mac, then use the respective commands and package managers to install these packages. Reach out to the instructors if you need help!
