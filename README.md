## Instructions
First, identify your computer's operation system (OS) from the list below and click on it. If the script does not work for you for some reason, you can run a manual installation, in which case you can keep a track of the [checklist](https://github.com/tushara04/YSP_Day1/blob/main/checklist.md) to ensure you have installed all the necessary applications.

1. [Windows](#windows) ([Manual Installation](https://github.com/tushara04/YSP_Day1/blob/main/manual_installations/windows.md))
2. [macOS](#macOS) ([Manual Installation](https://github.com/tushara04/YSP_Day1/blob/main/manual_installations/macOS.md))

### Windows
To install the applications, follow the instructions mentioned below carefully:
1. **Copy the code written below**: click on the overlaped squares you see on the right edge of the box below that contains the code: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff4005bb-9c20-4ea5-8dde-8acf57a135d0)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tushara04/YSP_Day1/refs/heads/main/windows/script.bat" -OutFile "script.bat"; Start-Process "script.bat"
```
2. **Open PowerShell**: click on the Windows key on your keyboard and type "powershell". Press the "Enter" key on your keyboard.
3. **Paste the copied code**: in the window that opens, press Ctrl+V (first press the left "Ctrl" key and then press the "V" key while holding the Ctrl key) on your keyboard. Then press the "Enter" key.
4. This should now open a new window (black screened terminal). If it does, great! Follow the instructions there.

If at any point the application "Visual Studio Code" opens, then that means everything is set. You can let your instructor know! :)
